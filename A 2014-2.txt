Technical Review

Apple shares have consolidated around the 20-day and 50-day moving averages which remain above the uptrending long-term MA. $510 to $525 was an area of consolidation in October and November, so the stock is probably due to break out of this balance area. The last two months have mostly traded $520 to $540. A positive report potentially retests December's $565 area with 2012's mid-$600s in the back of traders' minds. A negative report has various degrees of support down to the $507 200-day MA and below. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)



Summary

Analyst expectations for Apple earnings have come down from $10.91 to $10.19 over the last three months amid a slight revenue decline. Traders appear to be more optimistic, so EPS of around $10.50 might be needed to push the stock above the current balance area. The previous two quarters beat by 30c and 43c but the stock still traded lower. The Street is expected to cast a close eye on revenues, gross margins, iPhone shipments, and the sales forecast for the upcoming period.
