Q&A Session

Q: Gross margin came in at low end of guidance, can you rank for us the biggest factors that are limiting margin recovery?
A: March quarter, gross margin was 37.5% at low end of range. Had a few items that resulted in this: mix (more iPads and iPad mini into channel), changes in service policies, unfavorable adjustments. Guiding gross margin down 50 to 150 basis points sequentially. Largest reason is loss of leverage on sequentially lower revenue and a different product mix. Both of these will be partially offset by better costs in the quarter.

Q: Growth slowed in China to single digits, curious your perspective given stickiness and the fact that Apple is not in the biggest carrier there.
A: Greatest quarter for China ever, $8.8 billion including retail stores, up 11% year on year. Same as Apple's growth. Highlights included iPad growing 108% y/y, new records for sell through for iPad and iPhone. Significant y/y timing differences related to iPhone.

Last year, increased channel inventories by 2.6 million. 1.6 of that occurred in Greater China. If you look on a sell through basis, Greater China was up approximately 18%.

Going forward, we see a significant opportunity in China. It's a great market. Expect to double number of stores from 11 to 22 in less than 2 years. Added 8k iPhone point of sales to 19k. Have a plan to add more and further grow our distribution. This is too low currently.

Innovating in our online store there, adding different functionality to the store. China has an unusually high number of first time smartphone buyers. We've seen significant interest in iPhone 4 there and recently made it even more affordable to make it more attractive to those first time buyers.

Q: Competitive landscape in 2013 vs 2012? How has it surprised you?
A: Smartphone market has always been competitive. The names have changed. In the beginning, RIM was the strongest player. Today, our top competitor is Samsung married to Google. They're tough competitors but we feel that we have the best products by far. Continuing to invest in innovative products and feel really confident about our product pipeline in both hardware, software and services. We have the best ecosystem by far, plan to keep making it better. That shows up in loyalty ratings and customer satisfaction.

Q: How are you thinking about the pace of your buyback? What factors will you consider in purchase timing over next few years?
A: Begin buying shares beginning this month. Utilize remaining $58 billion by end of 2015, spanning 32 months. Accelerated share repurchase and to buy in the open market.

Q: You alluded to fall announcements. Does that mean there won't be big announcements before then or are you being more general?
A: Don't want to be more specific, but we have some really great stuff coming in the fall and across all of 2014.

Q: Talk about supply chain? Some concerns about product limitations, but getting huge relative to what you used to run. Talk about moving to new vendors?
A: We exited March quarter with no shortages while achieving inventory turns over 90, still staggering for our industry. The December was largest quarter ever in history of Apple and tech industry. Included unprecedented number of new products and ramps.

Work we do to produce truly innovative products is very hard. Challenges that we'll face in the future, but we're working very closely with our manufacturing partners and we are executing a very exciting roadmap.

Q: Revisit gross margin, comment on experiencing normal kinds of experience curves that you do in typical product ramps, can you comment on sequential decline in iPhone ASP (down $30 sequentially)? A mix of 4 and 4S relative to the 5, but can you confirm? What's the impact on margin going forward?
A: Very pleased with progress on getting cost curves down, help to offset loss of leverage and mix in next quarter, factored these cost improvements into our guidance. iPhone ASP is down sequentially because of mix. Increase in iPhone 4 mix, resulting from making iPhone 4 more affordable in many markets, also mix within iPhone 5 lineup.

Q: How do we think about margins for iPhone 4 vs 5?
A: We don't provide margins within product lines. Talked about two factors impacting gross margin on sequential basis. Leverage is largest reason for decline, but different product mix going forward on iPhone.

As you get further from a previous product launch, there is a general lower mix within a line than where it starts. You'd expect to see that on most of our products.

Q: You talked about excitement regarding large addressable markets. Talked about how strongly and confidently you feel about competitive advantage. If I step back and look at the data on the phone side, adjusted for inventory the iPhone was up low to mid single digits. Third party market data says market grew 30%. Next quarter, iPhone won't match the smartphone market growth overall. Is that a problem and is it something Apple cares about? What is the disconnect between market growth and your products?
A: Tablet numbers that we've seen from IDC, believe market declined 30% from December. We declined 15%. If that holds, we did better than the market and a nice pickup in market share. On iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is unparalleled. 350,000 apps for iPad, versus a few hundred for competition. Plus overall experience and fit and finish is better than options from competition.

On phone side, the numbers you talk about, the sell-in comparisons y/y, you have to look at sell through to examine demand. We did grow channel inventory last year to catch up on iPhone 4S rollout. You have to factor that to get at sell through. If market grew by 30%, we grew less than that. The point is not lost, we do want to grow faster than the market. We don't view it as the only measure of our health. The things that are important to us in addition to market share and unit volume include customer sat (highest by far), customer loyalty and repurchase (highest by far), and ecosystem commerce which attracts developers is incredible. 3/4 dollars spent on apps are spent in our ecosystem. Usage statistics are staggering comparing iOS to other operating systems. These other things are extremely important and we're all about customer experience and enriching lives.

That said, we see an enormous number of first time smartphone buyers coming to market particularly in certain countries around the world. What we've done there is to make the iPhone 4 even more affordable and more attractive to first time buyers. We are caught up on supply/demand on the 4 and we're continuing to do that in other markets. We believe that the phone for the price point that we're offering, is an incredible value for people that gets people into our ecosystem with a phenomenal product.

Q: Comment on gross margin beyond next quarter? What does it say about long term gross margins if 36-37 is the margin when your highest margin product is at a trough for the year? I think that's what you're implying. Is there an implied margin philosophy where this is as low as you want it to get, or is this not what we should be reading?
A: Been our long term practice that we aren't providing specific guidance beyond the June quarter. Many things that can affect margins and can cause them to vary widely over time. Don't want to make a forecast, but this is how we think about gross margin.

Managing the business for long term. Willing to trade short term profits for long term potential. Launched iPod in 2001, margins were significantly below margins for Apple. Later, iPod and iTunes comprised half of Apple's revenue. Inspired us to build the iPhone. iPad mini is similar, margins significantly below the corporate average. Only make great products. Won't make cheap ones.

Many people around the world who want great products. Made great business decisions to balance unit sales and profit. Managing Apple with a long term horizon. Much revenue comes after we ship our products. Received $4 billion in revenue for services for the first time, will augment ecosystem with new services and make existing ones even better.

Q: What is your reaction to what you think of the 5-inch phone market at this time versus 3 months ago. Has anything changed in your view?
A: My view continues to be that iPhone 5 has the best display in the industry. We always strive to create the very best display. Some customers value large screen size. Others value other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, reflectivity, power consumption, compatibility of apps, portability. Our competitors have made some significant tradeoffs in many of these areas to ship a larger display. We would not ship a larger display iPhone while these tradeoffs exist.

Q: Did you mention new product categories?
A: One of our areas for growth are potential new categories.

Q: Would that be in the next year?
A: Didn't announce a specific time frame.

Q: Mentioned new services and improving specific services, are there any other key access that you can leverage into new services?
A: Very fortunate to have the largest and broadest ecosystem in the world. App stores in 155 countries and iTunes in more than 110 countries. Hundreds of millions of users. $16 billion run rate on iTunes Stores in billings, and $4 billion in revenue for services. Opportunity to invest in tremendously to continue to grow our businesses in those areas.

Because we are not fragmented like our competition, we can update an OS with a major release and a substantial percentage of our customers will update to our latest software. We've made that elegant and easy. Because the usage for iOS is so much higher, when we integrate things well, people use them a lot more. So, just those concepts by themselves are huge advantages from a customer experience point of view and from the metrics that you're thinking about.

Q: In terms of payments market, do you feel this is well addressed with the offerings out there?
A: I think it's in its infancy. I think it's just getting started. Just out of the starting block.

Q: What are you thinking of in the Mac market versus the PC market? Curious whether you think elasticity of demand with lower prices, what you're hearing from your customers, or how are you feeling about cannibalization potential?
A: Reason that we were down last quarter (2%), market for PCs is incredibly weak. Market is down 14% y/y, largest decline that I can remember. We sold almost 20 million iPads, and its certainly true that some of those iPads cannibalized those Macs. I don't think it was a huge number but I think it's some. The larger thing here is that on the PC side people are extending their upgrade cycles. This market isn't a dead market or a bad market by any means. Has a lot of life to it, continue to innovate in it. If anything, the huge growth in tablets may wind up benefiting the Mac. It pushes people to think about that product in a different manner. People may be more willing to buy a Mac versus a PC. Will continue to make the best personal computers. Strategy isn't changing. Great innovation like the retina display, and more great stuff planned. Area we're continuing to invest in.

Q: Competitors starting to talk about wins in the enterprise. I'm curious what you've heard from your customers, seen much displacement? What are discussions you're having with enterprise customers with regards to iPads?
A: Seem to be doing really well. iOS accounting for 77% of activations by corporate customers according to one study. Would not include BlackBerry but would include the other guys. Seem to be doing really well, I don't see recent announcements changing that. More and more people developing custom apps for their businesses on iOS to be used on iPad, we're very bullish on it.

iPad now is being used in 95% of Fortune 500, on Global 500, we're in 89%.

Q: December quarter had broad product refresh. Did you learn that you should stagger those launches over multiple quarters instead of one quarter?
A: I don't spend a lot of time looking back except to learn from it. If we could run it over, I'd announce the iMac after the turn of the year. We felt customers had to wait too long for that specific product. The iPad mini was in shortage in the December quarter, I would not have done that differently. We were able to get the mini out to millions of customers who really wanted that for the holiday. Yes, we did do a lot, our teams can do a lot. In retrospect, that one I wish we were after the turn of the year so customers wouldn't have to wait as long as they did.

Q: Are you seeing acceleration in usage rates?
A: We see incredible usage in every study we see. Vast majority coming not from Apple. Usage of iOS devices are staggering compared to competitors. A phenomenal difference. That shows the strength of the ecosystem. We are now paying our developers more than $1 billion per quarter.
